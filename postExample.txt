T:

But anyway, here's a description of what is possible.

So, BigFix/TEM v9 has added a REST api to allow integration with other products, as well as providing commandline
execution/query of TEM data.  The CLI command for interacting with this is called 'iem'.  One 'logs in' with their console
password, and can then issue commands using 'iem'. For example:
	iem login --servername=GRASSKEET --user=adminMO --password=adminmo

then, a query of fixlets of the 'master' operator could be made, such as:
	iem get fixlets/master

resulting in something like:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<BESAPI xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="BESAPI.xsd">
        <Fixlet Resource="http://grasskeet:52311/api/fixlet/master/977?" LastModified="Wed, 13 Jul 2011 16:26:08 +0000">
                <Name>OSD - Deploy Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1</Name>
                <ID>977</ID>
        </Fixlet>
</BESAPI>

Also, I could 'take action' on one of these fixlets by creating an xml file like 'stopBesGather', with the appropriate 
ID & target specified as follows:

<BES xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="BES.xsd">
       <SourcedFixletAction>
               <SourceFixlet>
                       <Sitename>ActionSite</Sitename>
                       <FixletID>7234</FixletID>
                       <Action>Action1</Action>
               </SourceFixlet>
               <Target>
                       <ComputerName>GRASSKEET</ComputerName>
               </Target>
       </SourcedFixletAction>
</BES>

This assumes that fixlets with ID=7233 & 7234 exist and that the BESGather service is currently running (see attached
for my fixlets & my sample stopBesGather.xml & startBesGather.xml templates)

I can then start and stop the BesGather service using command lines as follows:
	
	iem post stopBesGather.xml actions

after which I can restart it using:

	iem post startBesGather.xml actions
[see the following:]

-bash-4.1$ iem login --server=GRASSKEET --user=adminMO --password=adminmo
Server  : GRASSKEET
User    : adminMO
Successfully logged in to server!
-bash-4.1$ iem post stopBesGather.xml actions
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<BESAPI xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="BESAPI.xsd">
        <Action Resource="http://GRASSKEET:52311/api/action/7236?" LastModified="Thu, 25 Apr 2013 18:16:41 +0000">
                <Name>Stop BESGather Service</Name>
                <ID>7236</ID>
        </Action>
</BESAPI>

You can also see the screenshots in the attached files:

There's a lot of information about this at this URL:

4) I've also set up a Linux Server and some VMs in the San Francisco TEC center, that we can 'play with' remotely, specifically, to
demonstrate Server Automation (if we don't have the time to get to that in your environment).  Let me know, and I'll show it to you.

Also, here's a TEM server on linux guide to installation, so you can see what's involved:
and some post-install DB2 'setup' commands:

Hope to 'catch you soon'.
